Description
===========
Vaiopower is a tool for power management of Sony Vaio laptop devices,
and it is intended for all the users who strive to extend their battery
life as much as possible. Vaiopower provides a higher level interface to
the power management options offered by the sony-laptop kernel module.
Additionally, prior to powering a device down, vaiopower makes sure that
the device has been deregistered from the system correctly, it unloads
all corresponding kernel modules and stops relevant system services.
After powering a device back up, vaiopower restores its previous state.
Vaiopower can be invoked manually, and it is also run automatically
during boot when it disables all devices set by user in vaiopower.conf.

In addition, the suite includes a pm-utils script that maintains the
power state of all devices across suspends and hibernations. Next,
vaiopower watches for udev events generated by the wireless killswitch
to make sure that it does not unwittingly turn on manually disabled
bluetooth. It also automatically fixes a bug experienced by some users
with docking stations, namely, the fact that the Ethernet adapter in the
docking station sometimes does not get detected.

Hardware Requirements
=====================
Vaiopower uses the SNY5001 (aka Sony Notebook Control or SonyNC) ACPI
device for managing DVD and sound card and SNY6001 (aka Sony
Programmable I/O Control, SPIC or SonyPI) for Bluetooth and WWAN.
However, not all Vaio laptops include these devices, and even if they
do, they do not always provide all the functionality.
Take a look into the /sys/devices/platform/sony-laptop/ directory to
find out whether the corresponding files (cdpower, audiopower,
bluetoothpower and wwanpower) are present. If some of these files are
missing, then those devices cannot be managed.

The up-to-date list of fully and partially supported hardware can be
found at http://vaio-utils.org/power/ .

Software Requirements
=====================
Vaiopower relies on udev, pm-utils, pciutils and dmidecode for part of
its functionality (namely, preserving power states across suspends,
hibernations and flipping of wireless killswitch and automatic enabling
of the Ethernet card in the docking station).
Vaiopower depends on unique features of the Linux kernel (the minimum
required version is 2.6.22, the recommended version is 2.6.30 or
higher), and it will not work on any other kernel.

Installation
============
1. Vaiopower consists of a set of shell scripts, so there is no need to
build anything.

2. Copy all the files into their appropriate locations by running:
	# make install

By default, the executable, config file, documentation and man pages are
installed into the /usr/local subtree. Additionally, three config files
are copied into /etc/udev/rules.d, /etc/pm/sleep.d and
/etc/bash_completion.d, respectively.

If you want to install into /usr instead of /usr/local, just run
    # make prefix=/usr install

3. If you want vaiopower to disable some device automatically at boot
time, make sure an init script is installed. Several init scripts are
provided with the programme; they can be found in the init-scripts
directory.

Then you may want to edit vaiopower.conf to adjust the list of devices
to be powered down at boot time (by default, all are left on). The file
is located in /usr/local/etc provided you have installed with
"make install", or in /etc in case you used "make prefix=/usr install".
